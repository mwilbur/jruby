/**
 * Meant as a simple interface for all the various methods we will want
 * the interpreter to have without having to commit to many technical details.
 *
 * For example if we add primitive variable operations then we will need to
 * add setters which are unboxed.  The ability to get and set in multiple ways
 * will mean a proliferation of methods to support this without needing to
 * make huge changes to operands or instructions (other than calling the new
 * method on this context).
 *
 * This is also a interface by matter of moving forward.  This could all also
 * be right on InterpretedIRMethod, but by having an interface the compiler
 * can "cheat" initially and use the same context for some of the more difficult
 * parts until it finds the best way.
 *
 * SSS: InterpreterContext is actually the closure environment
